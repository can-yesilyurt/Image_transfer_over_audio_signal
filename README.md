# Image_transfer_over_audio_signal
Demonstration of an image transfer tool where the data is carried by any analog signal such as audio. It relies on inverse spectrogram  of the target image for preparation and then the obtained 1D array is converted to e.g., audio signal. After transmitting the audio, the image can be reconstructed by calculating audio spectrogram. The nice part is that the audio signal containing the image can be send/received over the air  between devices. It works without requiring local network or internet, so it might  be practical to transfer image or share information in  such environments between devices near to each other.
